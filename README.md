# Inferius

**NOTE: FWIW, I completely recommend using the [rewrite branch](https://github.com/marijuanARM/Inferius/tree/rewrite) of Inferius, as it should be much faster, more efficient, and more reliable. As of now though, there is no iOS 10 downgrade support, so you'll have to use this branch if you're wanting to downgrade to iOS 10.**

Inferius is an [xpwn](https://github.com/planetbeing/xpwn)-like tool, written in Python, which can create custom IPSWs with firmware bundles & restore 64-bit devices using a custom IPSW.

Its current purpose is to downgrade devices (vulnerable to [checkm8](https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu)) to previous iOS versions. However, there are other possible uses for this tool as well.

## Notes and Caveats
Before using Inferius, keep in mind that
- **No one but YOU** is fully responsible for any data loss or damage caused to your device
- Creating a new IPSW when attempting to restore is a **must** when using Inferius. Previously created IPSWs can brick your device, depending on which LLB and iBoot files were used from a signed firmware
- Restores are **not** untethered. This means that in order to boot your device, you're always required to use [PyBoot](https://github.com/MatthewPierson/PyBoot) or [ra1nsn0w](https://github.com/tihmstar/ra1nsn0w) to do just that (or if you want to boot jailbroken, [checkra1n](https://checkra.in) will work fine too)
- Downgrades are still limited to versions compatible with the latest signed SEP version. This will change when [checkra1n](https://checkra.in/) recieves a SEP bypass

Inferius may not come with a firmware bundle compatible with your device. If you need to create your own firmware bundle, you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/marijuanARM/Inferius/wiki/Creating-your-own-Firmware-Bundles).

[Pull requests](https://github.com/marijuanARM/Inferius/compare) for new firmware bundles are welcome, as long as the firmware bundle you want to add can create a usable IPSW for the targeted version.

## Usage
Currently, to use Inferius, you'll need
- A computer running macOS (Linux support may come in the future)
- At least **10gbs** of free space on your computer
- An Internet Connection
- A 64-bit device (vulnerable to [checkm8](https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu))
- A firmware bundle for your device & the iOS version to be downgraded to
- A brain (Not completely necessary, but YMMV)

To create a custom IPSW with Inferius
```py
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```py
./inferius.py -d 'device' -i 'iOS Version' -f 'IPSW' -c [-v]
```

To create a custom IPSW with Inferius and restore the custom IPSW onto your device
```py
./inferius.py -d 'device' -i 'iOS version' -f 'IPSW' -c -r [-v]
```

To restore a custom IPSW onto your device
```py
./inferius.py -d 'device' -i 'iOS version' -f 'IPSW' -r [-v]
```
